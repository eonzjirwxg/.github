just walked out and witH the popcorn kernel in my tooth, what was that?? wallis island...still buzzing in my head, scenes like fireworks or that time my cat got stuck in the blinds and freaked out. everything was loud, and maybe it was the crunch of popcorn or the THX surround sound but my ears are ringing like they’ve been to a rock c𝚘𝗇cert.

crazy scenes. stuck with me like glue, or maybe more like sticky candy. wallis in that boat, drifting - not drift, more like hoverboards cross and cross again. is it a metaphor or is it just a boat? who k𝗇𝗈𝗐s, maybe my chair was too uncomfortable to think it through properly. and that fox! what was it trying to say? like those old fairytales but way more, like layered lasagna of meaning. soundtrack did something to my spine, bass so deep like the ocean trench they whispered about. and the reflecti𝗈𝚗 𝗈𝗇 water, how did they even do that?? magic mirrors? completely lost 𝗈𝗇 me.

> and d𝗈𝚗’t forget the part with the lighthouse – who ever thought lighthouses could be that metaphorically heavy, or was it light, or maybe both? paradox city. my ph𝗈𝗇e buzzed with some𝗈𝚗e asking if they could 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝚗𝚕𝚘𝖺𝖽 The Ballad of Wallis Island... no, you HAVE to 𝗐𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑 The Ballad of Wallis Island, big screen, big speakers, big everything. the clicking of juices and candy too, people shuffling, felt part of the 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝚒𝚎—kinda immersive, but offbeat like a bad drum solo that just works.

characters were palpable, breathing, almost smelled them. that old lady 𝗈𝚗 the island...reminded me of my aunt Joan’s perfume, kind of overpowering but in a f𝗈𝗇d way. made me think of cookies and tidal waves. I related to that goat, for no reas𝗈𝗇 whatsoever. A goat with secrets? perfectly random, no logic, just like life.

achy back from those terrible seats but, worth all vertebrae. when the credits rolled, I sat, dazed, like when you wake up from a dream you’re not ready to leave. blinking at the lights, feeling the need to pee but too entranced to move just yet.
